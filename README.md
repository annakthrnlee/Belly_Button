# Belly_Button
## From Bacteria to Beef
Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. The bacterial species used in the analysis are the ones that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Labs across the country have had success synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. Candidates from across the country have volunteered to give samples of bacteria species that colonize human belly buttons. The candidates have been assigned an ID number that serves as their "anonymous name". 

## Overview:
This analysis was created on a dashboard that displays information about the bacteria that lives inside the human's belly button. Samples were collected from hundreds of consenting people and recorded into a data file. My job as a data professional was to analyze the data and draw conclusions from it, as well as create visualizations to communicate my findings to an audience. Using the power of JavaScript, I created data visualizations that are attractive, accessible, and interactive. Using Plotly.js my visualizations are interactive and easy to understand for any audience! You don't need to have any software downloaded on your computer to interact with my webpage, making it easy for anyone to view. 

## Software:
- JavaScript (Plotly.js)
- D3.json
