# Belly_Button
### Throughout this project, I created three different charts (bar, plot, and gauge) that display the findings collected from volunteers. The volunteers all consented to given samples so scientists could identify the top 10 bacterial species prevalent in human belly buttons. My website portrays the findings and is customized for my users so they can review the information with easy and eye-appealing charts. Users can also use the drop down menu "Test Subject ID Number" to view each volunteers demographic info.
